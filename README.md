## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB

* It is simple to use. No need to install any plug-in or add any dependency. It works with a simple POST request.

* It's real-time and in-memory, so can used in projects like games or chat applications so that users don't have to refresh every time there's an update in the backend.

* It's serverless, so you don't have to learn about machine types and configure the server's zone and regions. Also, you don't have to worry about the cost increasing every minute the server is used.

* It's multi-mode, so it's a one-stop database solution for all your data, whether it's a document DB, key-value DB, RDBMS, geo-spatial, or time-series DB.

* It indexes all columns. Any queries on a big database will be very fast without needing to create indexes explicitly for columns.

* It provides an intuitive visual dashboard.

* Since it's schema-free, it's easier to enter data without worrying about the number of columns or their types.

* Since it supports multiple data models, you don't have to worry whether my data is structured, unstructured, or semi-structured.

* It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
